# Examples of use cases

Since this solution focuses on providing the [building blocks](#concepts) of any financial app – accounts, balances, and assets –, there is a wide range of use cases. Some examples:

- **Digital wallets** with complete tracking of transactions and multiple asset support

- **Issuing and use of digital currencies or security tokens** via the [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org) network

- **Interoperable layer** between applications and closed-loop payment systems

- **Infrastructure for [fast payments](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1703z.htm)**, with transaction authorization and settlement in real time
