# DLT Networks

Swipe API works by connecting with distributed networks (DLT), also called in some cases Blockchain networks.

We operate with 3 networks, each oriented for specific use cases. All [concepts](#concepts) work equally in all networks, and the average confirmation time for each [Action](#actions) is 6 seconds.

Currently, we offer the following options:

## Swipe Network

Recommended for most [use cases](#examples-of-use-cases), Swipe Network is a **permissioned** network – meaning that access is restricted to authorized users – that secures the access to information, safeguarding data privacy.

## Stellar Network

[Stellar](https://stellar.org) is an **open** network recommended for global applications. This network is especially suitable for projects involving international remmittances or fundraising (such as ICOs or STOs) because of its large user base and marketplace integration, which is facilitated by a [native exchange](https://www.stellarx.com) built directly on the network.

## Dedicated Network

In cases of high demands for scalability, as is the case in corporate environments, we recommend using a network with fully exclusive infrastructure. To explore the creation of a dedicated network for your company, [contact us](#contact).
